# BinaryTree
Java contains no BinaryTree object, which requires building new structures or modifying old ones whenever such a tree is needed. These TreeNode and BinaryTree classes intend to serve as a basic BST that can be easily adjusted to contain any type of object. Final product will contain all user-functionality of a standard Java class. This is currently a work in progress and is not ready for general use.
